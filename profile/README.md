This is the README. Allegedly.

There were plans. Grand ones. Diagrams. Maybe even a roadmap.

Then reality happened.

So here's what we have for now:

- This exists.
- It's probably doing something cool.
- We’ll explain eventually. Probably. Maybe.
- If you’re reading this, congrats — you’re early.

Updates? Sure. When the stars align or someone gets inspired at 2 P.M.

Until then, poke around. Or don’t. It’s fine.
